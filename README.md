## Getting started

You will need to install barc4plots to run the notebook... you can find it here: [barc4plots](https://gitlab.esrf.fr/celestre/barc4plots)... make sure that [srw](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW) (or the [OASYS distribution](https://github.com/oasys-kit/OASYS1-srwpy)) is installed! That's it =)# SRWL_uti_PSD
